# Algorithm Framework and Applications in Machine Learning

## Overview
This artifact maps key machine learning algorithms to their learning type (supervised, unsupervised, generative) and their main application domains (tabular data, computer vision, NLP, and generative AI). It is designed as both a technical reference and a professional portfolio piece.

## Visual Framework
See the infographic in this folder:
- `Algorithm_Framework_Infographic.png`

The infographic shows:
- Supervised Learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, CNN, RNN)
- Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, PCA)
- Generative AI (Transformers, GANs)

and connects them to:
- Tabular Data
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Generative AI content creation

## Algorithm Explanations
### Linear Regression
Predicts continuous numeric values by fitting a linear relationship between features and a target. Commonly used in forecasting (for example, sales or pricing).

### Decision Tree
Splits data using yes/no questions on features to classify or predict outcomes. Used in areas like fraud decisioning and credit risk review.

### Random Forest
Ensemble of many decision trees. Reduces overfitting and improves accuracy. Used in risk scoring, medical prediction, and churn prediction.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Finds the best boundary between classes. Strong for classification tasks like spam detection and image-based defect detection.

### K-Means Clustering
Unsupervised grouping of similar data points into “clusters.” Used for customer segmentation and behavioral grouping.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Reduces dimensionality by compressing many features into a smaller number of components without losing critical variance. Used for visualization, compression, and noise reduction.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Deep learning model for images. Extracts patterns like edges, shapes, and objects. Used in medical imaging, object detection, and face recognition.

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Neural network for sequential data such as text, speech, and time series. Learns from previous steps in a sequence. Used in speech recognition and fraud pattern monitoring.

### Transformer (GPT/BERT)
Uses attention to understand long-range context in language. Powers language models, summarization, chat assistants, and automated report generation.

### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
Two networks (generator + discriminator) compete to create realistic synthetic data like faces, products, or scenes. Used in creative design, simulation, and data augmentation.

## Reflection

### Customization for the Audience
This artifact is written for instructors, classmates, and future employers. The goal is to communicate complex AI/ML ideas in clear language, with direct use cases, so readers from different backgrounds can quickly understand where each algorithm is useful.

### Lessons Learned
By building this, I learned how different algorithm families solve different types of problems: prediction, grouping, sequence modeling, vision, and content generation. I also strengthened the link between theory and application in business settings like fraud monitoring, customer segmentation, and automated reporting.

### Feedback and Revisions
Previous feedback on my portfolio emphasized clarity, structure, and professional presentation. I applied that here by pairing a visual summary (the infographic) with readable explanations and reflection, so the artifact shows not only technical knowledge but also communication and leadership thinking.
