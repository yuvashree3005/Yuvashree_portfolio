  <h2>Reflections</h2>

  <h3>Artifact 1 Reflection: AI Timeline Presentation</h3>
  <p>
    Building the AI Timeline helped me deepen my understanding of AI’s historical evolution.
    I customized the timeline to focus on major innovations relevant to today’s technological
    landscape. Through this project, I improved my ability to research, select, and visually
    communicate complex information. Feedback encouraged better organization, which strengthened
    my storytelling skills. This artifact taught me how important historical context is when
    leading discussions about AI.
  </p>

  <h3>Artifact 2 Reflection: Power BI Dashboard for Customer Insights</h3>
  <p>
    This dashboard project taught me how to transform data into meaningful insights for business
    leaders. I tailored the dashboard to banking needs by segmenting customers by value and churn
    risk. Feedback from peers led me to enhance visualization clarity by adjusting filters and
    categories. I learned how to create executive-ready dashboards that drive decision-making —
    a skill that directly strengthens my leadership ability in financial services.
  </p>

  <h3>Artifact 3 Reflection: Chatbot-Based Learning of ML Concepts</h3>
  <p>
    Using ChatGPT to learn about machine learning enhanced both my technical understanding and my
    ability to explain technical concepts. I designed the learning session to be beginner-friendly,
    using real-world examples to illustrate supervised and unsupervised learning. Feedback encouraged
    me to enrich examples and draw clearer parallels to everyday scenarios. This artifact demonstrated
    my ability to self-learn complex topics and translate them into simple, digestible educational
    materials.
  </p>

  <h3>Artifact 4 Reflection: Machine Learning Model for Customer Churn Prediction</h3>
  <p>
    This project tied directly into my career goals in retail banking leadership. I built predictive
    models to identify customer churn risks, customizing features based on business relevance.
    Feedback highlighted the importance of including customer behavior signals like tenure and
    complaints, which I incorporated. This artifact showcased my ability to create real-world AI
    models that align with business needs and improve retention strategies — key for leadership roles.
  </p>

  <h3>Artifact 5 Reflection: Business Case for AI-Driven Personalization in Retail Banking</h3>
  <p>
    This artifact demonstrated my ability to align AI strategies with tangible business goals.
    I built a structured business case that connected AI personalization technologies to customer
    satisfaction, cross-selling opportunities, and churn reduction. Feedback emphasized the need
    to highlight ethical risks, which I integrated into my recommendations. This artifact shows
    I can communicate the value of AI investment to senior executives while balancing innovation
    with responsible AI governance.
  </p>

  <!-- NEW REFLECTION FOR ARTIFACT 6 -->
  <h3>Artifact 6 Reflection: Algorithm Framework and Applications in Machine Learning</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Customization for the Audience:</strong>
    I built this artifact for both academic reviewers and professional stakeholders. The visual layout
    is designed to be readable for non-technical leaders, while the detailed write-up supports technical
    evaluation. I intentionally connected each algorithm to real business decisions, including fraud
    monitoring, customer segmentation, and automated reporting.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>
    Creating this artifact helped me clearly see how supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
    and generative AI solve different classes of problems. I learned how traditional models like
    Random Forest and modern models like Transformers each support different parts of an organization:
    prediction, grouping, language understanding, and content generation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Feedback and Revisions:</strong>
    My previous portfolio feedback emphasized clarity and audience relevance. I applied that here by
    pairing a clean infographic with a structured written explanation and reflection. The result shows
    not just that I understand the algorithms, but that I can communicate them in a way that supports
    leadership and decision-making.
